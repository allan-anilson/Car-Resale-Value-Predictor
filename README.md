# Car-Resale-Value-Predictor

This project is a simple web application that predicts the resale value of a car in India based on the inputs entered by the user such as Company Name, Car Model, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kms Travelled with their respective unique values that can be selected via a drop-down list. 

This is a simple Machine Learning project that implements the Linear Regression Model. It uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, flask, pickle etc.

Feel free to give constructive criticism, so that I may be able to improve this simple project as time progresses!
